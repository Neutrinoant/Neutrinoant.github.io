You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class=\"language-text\">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>\n<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>\n<p>Where <code class=\"language-text\">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class=\"language-text\">MONTH</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class=\"language-text\">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter.
